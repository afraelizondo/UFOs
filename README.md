# UFOs

## Overview

This project was performed with the main objective of creating dynamic content with JavaScript, the most used programming language in the world. Also, we needed the help of HTML and some bootstraps skills. 

The team worked along with Dana to create a successful final result; a table to organize UFO data stored in a JavaScript array that has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria as: date, city, state, country and shape. 

The current table was presented within the webpage created with HTML, so the people exploring this page can filter the information they want to display depending upon which are their interests in certain criteria. 

CSS was used to redesign the aspect of the webpage, in this way, the default colors were changed with the purpose of making it look more attractive for the human eye. 

## Results

Our webpage is divided in three main sections:
1. Header, with the principal title and an image as background.

2. Body, with subtitle and preview of the content.

And lastly, the table created with features for the searching criteria that was expected.

As we can see in Figure 1, there is specific data in each field, so the webpage is gonna retrieve the data that contains them. Each user using the webpage would be able to get the desire results. 

In figure 2, we will see the correct output with the previous data.

## Summary 

In general, the webpage that we performed has only the basic elements, but one drawback would be that there is only one image related to the topic instead of many, this is a visual element that in my opinion is important due to the fact that many people that will visit may have visual engagement. 

For further development I'd suggest:
- Include the "duration" in the filters as well. Some people could be interested in this column more than in the others. 
- Include videos and media of some of the events occured.
